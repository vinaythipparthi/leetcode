Leetcode Problem - 1342
Question - Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

Java
Approach
Step1: Create count variable to count no.of steps to become zero.
Step2: Iterate num until it becomes 0
Step3: if it is even divide num with 2 else subtract it with 1.
Step4: Return count;
Note: Don't forget to increament count in if and else statements..

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Code
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        while(num!=0){
            if(num%2==0){
                num = num/2;
                count++;
            }
            else{
                num--;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
